Recently, reading the twitter feed I came into [this](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/10/06/developer-experience-gap/) really insightful blog titled "The Developer Experience Gap". It quickly caught my attention because I've already seen this topic discussed in some other places and the conclusions usually point to "developer experice" as the next area where big things still have to happen.

Reading that blog post really made me aware that the greatness, the power, the endless possibilities that the cloud and modern technologies bring are not that nice, yet, from developer experice point of view.

In most cases modern development tools and infrastructure do not play nice with each other and developers have the responsibility to glue them all together in their development workflows, and of course developers have to maintain over time all that patchwork to be able to continue shipping their applications to production.

But actually this is no surprise, I can understand the fact that with great power comes great responsibility, and developer toolchains are not less.

Reading that blog post it got me thinking after reading it. It says most developer toolchains, managing from basic development workflows to handover to production stages are made of a series of patches glued all together and of course maintained by developers. There is no surprise in that words, this is the situation we are living. But it gets even more interesting when they say "every part of an application development workflow needs to be better and more smoothly integrated".

"Most toolchains, from where the first lines of code are written through test, build, integration and deployment all the way out to production, are made up of a patchwork quilt of products and services from different suppliers."

After reading that blog I quickly got inspired to start, as I usually do, a new side project, why not? I thought... I read just enough about the topic and quickly started coding, I had a goal.
