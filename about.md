As you may imagine I'm Fabi√°n, I grew in a village in Albacete (Spain) and I'm currently living in Valencia where I studied computer science at [UPV](https://www.upv.es/){: .link_strong }.
Nowadays I'm a proud Red Hat employee working as a Quality Engineer.

Aside from the tech world I like to play videogames(wait a minute that is still tech, isn't it?), spend time with my friends and practice climbing.
